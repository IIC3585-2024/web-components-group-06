# Web Components

We have developed 2 different components to show the usefulness of using web components in the development of a web application. We used 2 approaches, using the standard elements (template, custom element & shadow DOM) and using the lit-html and lit-element library. We show those elements in a simple application to create the components and interact with them, we have also integrated a bitcoin api and other web components already developed to show the easy integration of these components to our application.
